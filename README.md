# belly-button-challenge
Module 14

In order to finish this challenge, I attended all office hours that were scheduled, met with a tutor twice, and spent a considerable amount of time studying previous class assignments in order to create this app. I referenced youtube to help me initialize the GitHub Pages, and was finally able to change the 'src' command in the html file to load the data into the html object. My teachers really took the time to help me understand how to think about the functions at work with this assignment, and once I was able to initalize the data I was then able to format the charts with (a lot of) trial and error.
