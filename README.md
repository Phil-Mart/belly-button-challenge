JavaScript

In this dynamic HTML page, I utilized the JavaScript library D3.js to make an asynchronous script that populates a series of displays based on the values of a pull-down menu.  For any test subject ID chosen, the DOM object will change its visualizations and metadata display. The bubble chart is even capable of displaying hover-values when the cursor is over any specific bubble. 

By using the '.io' script in the repository name, I was also able to launch this html within GitHub's Pages, making the display app launchable and within the url. You will find it very mobile friendly as a result; simply load the repo link into your mobile browser and explore the functional model application.
